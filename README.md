Screen 2 (Search Screen): a type-along search which searches for planets and lists them in components that are sized relative to their population on every keypress in the input field. (eg: a bigger font size for a planet with larger population, or a bigger container size for a planet with larger population). On clicking the item from the results of the type-along search, it will display the corresponding planet's information. C00l Shit!
