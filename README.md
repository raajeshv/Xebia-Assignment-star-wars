# STAR WARS

[![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/saranshbansal/starwarsinreact.svg)](https://greenkeeper.io/)

Using API from the website http://swapi.co. 

## Description

The application is supposed to have 2 screens: 

Screen 1 (Login Screen) Allow the user to login as a character from STAR WARS using the character name as the username and birth year as the password. Example: • Username: Luke Skywalker • Password : 19BBY  

Screen 2 (Search Screen) Implement a type-along search which searches for planets and lists them in components that are sized relative to their population on every keypress in the input field. (eg: a bigger font size for a planet with larger population, or a bigger container size for a planet with larger population). On clicking the item from the results of the type-along search, it should display the corresponding planet information. 

Provide the relevant Logout flow properly in your application. 

## Feature: • Only the user Luke Skywalker should be able to make more than 15 searches in a minute. 

Below you will find some information on how to perform common tasks.<br>

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](#running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](#deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
