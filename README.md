# starwarsinreact
A React application having two screens with proper navigation. Using API from the website http://swapi.co. The application is supposed to have 2 screens: Screen 1 (Login Screen) Allow the user to login as a character from STAR WARS using the character name as the username and birth year as the password. Example: • Username: Luke Skywalker • Password : 19BBY  Screen 2 (Search Screen) Implement a type-along search which searches for planets and lists them in components that are sized relative to their population on every keypress in the input field. (eg: a bigger font size for a planet with larger population, or a bigger container size for a planet with larger population). On clicking the item from the results of the type-along search, it should display the corresponding planet information. Provide the relevant Logout flow properly in your application. Feature: • Only the user Luke Skywalker should be able to make more than 15 searches in a minute.
